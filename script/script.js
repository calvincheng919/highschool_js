// What are variables?
// Something you can assign a value to... 

var myVar = 5; //the process of putting something in a variable is called 'assignment'
// 5 is a number

console.log('myVar is: ', myVar); 

// Let's do some math, and print the result to the console 

console.log('myVar plus 3: ', myVar + 3);

// What about strings? How do we handle strings?

var myString = 'JavaScript is very cool.';
var myAddOn = 'This is the best language in the world. You guessed'

//adding strings is called 'concatenation'. We concatenate strings together. Short version 'concat'


// non-typed language.
console.log(myString + ' ' + myAddOn + ' ' + myVar + 3);

//5+3 = 8
//'5' + '3' = '53'
